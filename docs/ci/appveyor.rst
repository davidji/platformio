AppVeyor
========

`AppVeyor <http://www.appveyor.com/about>`_ is an open-source hosted,
distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects
hosted at `GitHub <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>`_ on Windows family
systems.

AppVeyor is configured by adding a file named ``appveyor.yml``, which is a
`YAML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format text file, to the root
directory of the GitHub repository.

AppVeyor automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a
GitHub repository that is using AppVeyor, and each time this happens, it will
try to build the project using :ref:`cmd_ci` command. This includes commits to
all branches, not just to the master branch. AppVeyor will also build and run
pull requests. When that process has completed, it will notify a developer in
the way it has been configured to do so â€” for example, by sending an email
containing the build results (showing success or failure), or by posting a
message on an IRC channel. It can be configured to build project on a range of
different :ref:`platforms`.

Integration
-----------

Put ``appveyor.yml`` to the root directory of the GitHub repository.

.. code-block:: yaml

    build: off
    environment:

      matrix:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\file.c"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\file.ino"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\directory"

    install:
        - cmd: git submodule update --init --recursive
        - cmd: SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts
        - cmd: pip install -U platformio

    test_script:
        - cmd: platformio ci --board=TYPE_1 --board=TYPE_2 --board=TYPE_N


For more details as for PlatformIO build process please look into :ref:`cmd_ci`
command.

Examples
--------

1. Integration for `USB_Host_Shield_2.0 <https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0>`_
   project. The ``appveyor.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build: off
    environment:

      matrix:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "examples\\Bluetooth\\PS3SPP\\PS3SPP.ino"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "examples\\pl2303\\pl2303_gps\\pl2303_gps.ino"

    install:
        - cmd: git submodule update --init --recursive
        - cmd: SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts
        - cmd: pip install -U platformio
        - cmd: git clone https://github.com/xxxajk/spi4teensy3.git C:\spi4teensy

    test_script:
        - cmd: platformio ci --lib="." --lib="C:\\spi4teensy" --board=uno --board=teensy31 --board=due
