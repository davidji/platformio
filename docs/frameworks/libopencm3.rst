    * - :ref:`platform_ststm32`
      - The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash MCUs based on the ARM Cortex-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers a 32-bit product range that combines very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power, low-voltage operation, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

    * - :ref:`platform_titiva`
      - Texas Instruments TM4C12x MCUs offer the industrys most popular ARM Cortex-M4 core with scalable memory and package options, unparalleled connectivity peripherals, advanced application functions, industry-leading analog integration, and extensive software solutions.
