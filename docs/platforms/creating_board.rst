Custom Embedded Board
=====================

*PlatformIO* has pre-built settings for the most popular embedded boards. This
list is available:

* `Embedded Boards Explorer <http://platformio.org/boards>`_ (Web)
* :ref:`cmd_boards` (CLI command)

Nevertheless, PlatformIO allows to create own board or override existing
board's settings. All data is declared using
`JSON-style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ via
`associative array <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array>`_
(name/value pairs).

JSON Structure
--------------

The key fields:

* ``build`` data will be used by :ref:`platforms` and :ref:`frameworks` builders
* ``frameworks`` is the list with supported :ref:`frameworks`
* ``platform`` main type of :ref:`platforms`
* ``upload`` upload settings which depend on the ``platform``

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "myboard": {
            "build": {},
            "frameworks": ["%LIST_WITH_SUPPORTED_FRAMEWORKS%"],
            "name": "My test board",
            "platform": "%PLATFORM_TYPE_HERE%",
            "upload": {},
            "url": "http://example.com",
            "vendor": "My Company Ltd."
        }
    }

Installation
------------

1. Create ``boards`` directory in :ref:`projectconf_pio_home_dir` if it
   doesn't exist.
2. Create ``my_own_boards.json`` file and put to ``boards`` directory.
3. Search available boards via :ref:`cmd_boards` command. You should see
   ``myboard`` board.

Now, you can use ``myboard`` for the :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in
:ref:`projectconf`.


Examples
--------

For the examples, please look into built-in ``*.json`` files with boards
settings: https://github.com/platformio/platformio/tree/develop/platformio/boards.
