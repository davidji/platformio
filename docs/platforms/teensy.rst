Platform ``teensy``
===================
Teensy is a complete USB-based microcontroller development system, in a very small footprint, capable of implementing many types of projects. All programming is done via the USB port. No special programmer is needed, only a standard USB cable and a PC or Macintosh with a USB port.

For more detailed information please visit `vendor site <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy>`_.

.. warning::
    **Linux Users:** Don't forget to install "udev" rules file
    `99-platformio-udev.rules <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/blob/develop/scripts/99-platformio-udev.rules>`_ (an instruction is located in the file).


    **Windows Users:** Teensy programming uses only Windows built-in HID
    drivers. When Teensy is programmed to act as a USB Serial device,
    Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8 require `this serial driver
    <http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/serial_install.exe>`_
    is needed to access the COM port your program uses. No special driver
    installation is necessary on Windows 10.


Frameworks

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - :ref:`framework_arduino`
      - Arduino Wiring-based Framework allows writing cross-platform software to control devices attached to a wide range of Arduino boards to create all kinds of creative coding, interactive objects, spaces or physical experiences.

    * - :ref:`framework_mbed`
      - The mbed framework The mbed SDK has been designed to provide enough hardware abstraction to be intuitive and concise, yet powerful enough to build complex projects. It is built on the low-level ARM CMSIS APIs, allowing you to code down to the metal if needed. In addition to RTOS, USB and Networking libraries, a cookbook of hundreds of reusable peripheral and module libraries have been built on top of the SDK by the mbed Developer Community.

Boards
------

.. note::
    * You can list pre-configured boards by :ref:`cmd_boards` command or
